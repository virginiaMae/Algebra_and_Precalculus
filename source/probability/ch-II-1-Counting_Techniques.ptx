  <title>Counting Techniques</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>Chapter 1 introduces students to counting techniques necessary for the 
      study of probability. How many outcomes are possible when rolling two dice? 
      when flipping four coins? when drawing five cards from a deck of 52? The 
      basic building block is the General Counting Principle, from which 
      Permutations are a specific application. The connection between Permutations 
      and Combinations is developed, as well as the connection between Binary 
      models (coin flips) and Combinations.</p>

      <p>Seeing the interconnectedness of these topics is important for success 
        in probability and students should be encouraged to focus on the 
        similarities between topics. For example, why is the formula for 
        combinations the same as the formula for permutations with an extra 
        factor in the denominator? What is the extra factor? What does it represent?</p>
      
      <p>The lesson on Permutations is presented in two parts. Part I follows the 
        General Counting Principle and places ALL members of a set in order. 
        Part II does the generalization when only some of the members are placed 
        in order.</p>
