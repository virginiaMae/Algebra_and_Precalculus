    <title>Point-Point Form of a Line</title>
    <p><em>Point-Point Form of a Line</em> relies on the 
        <xref ref="sec-4-6-Point_Slope_Form_of_a_Line" text="title"/> 
        and adds no new notation or formula. It is connected to the 
        <xref ref="sec-4-5-Slope_Intercept_Form" text="title"/> in two examples, 
        including the <em>Intercept-Intercept Form of a Line</em>, which 
        is treated as a special case here.</p>
