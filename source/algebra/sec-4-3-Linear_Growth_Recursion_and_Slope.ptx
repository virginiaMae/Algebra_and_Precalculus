    <title>Linear Growth, Recursion and Slope</title>
    <p><em>Linear Growth, Recursion and Slope</em> examines linear equations from a 
        recursive definition. The intent is to connect the standard formulation of slope 
        with the more intuitive notion of arithmetic sequences. It stresses the 
        time sequence where future values are found be repeated addition. It pays 
        close attention to the notation used in sequences, particularly the subscripts on 
        the variables and how they relate to the input of a function.</p>
