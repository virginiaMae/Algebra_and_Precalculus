  <title>Quadratics, Polynomials, and Rational Expressions</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>This chapter covers the graphical, general, standard and root forms of a parabola, 
      and the activities establish the connections between them. This leads to several 
      approaches to the quadratic formula and finding roots of a quadratic polynomial, 
      as well as several approaches to find the vertex of a parabola, a key step in 
      optimization problems. The latter half of this chapter expands these ideas to 
      general polynomials and then to rational expressions to build the basics of curve 
      sketching techniques used in calculus.</p>
