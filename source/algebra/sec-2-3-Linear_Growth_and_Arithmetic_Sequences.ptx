    <title>Linear Growth and Arithmetic Sequences</title>
    <p><em>Linear Growth and Arithmetic Sequences</em> discusses the recursion of repeated addition to 
        arrive at an arithmetic sequence. The explicit formula is also discussed, including 
        its connection to the recursive formula and to the <xref ref="sec-4-5-Slope_Intercept_Form" text="title"/>
         of a Line. We prefer sequences to begin with the term <m>a_0</m>  rather than <m>a_1</m> so that 
         the connection between the starting point <m>a_0</m> and the <m>y</m>-intercept of a line 
         can be established. Therefore, the explicit formula is given as
         <m>a_n = a_0 + n d</m> rather than <m>a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d</m>.</p>
