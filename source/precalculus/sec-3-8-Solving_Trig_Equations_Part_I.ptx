    <title>Solving Trig Equations - Part I</title>
    <p><em>Solving Trig Equations – Part I</em> covers examples where it is necessary to find a set of 
        angles that solve an equation involving trig functions. We choose to find all solutions, not 
        just those on the interval <m>[0, 2\pi)</m> to emphasize the periodicity of the solutions. 
        Several examples employ algebraic techniques and students may need to review solving 
        algebraic equations. Further examples involving more complicated angles are saved for
