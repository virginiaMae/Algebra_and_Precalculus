    <title>Graphs of Waves</title>
    <p><em>Graphs of Waves</em> shows the details of the graphs of 
        <m>y = \sin x</m> and <m>y = \cos x</m>. Close attention is paid to graphing one 
        complete wave from <m>0</m> to <m>2 \pi</m>, including points corresponding to each of 
        the special unit circle angles. This is far more detail than is necessary for 
        most applications, but does show the roundedness of the waves. The pattern 
        then repeats and this periodic nature is shown briefly to give students an understanding 
        of the long range behavior of the functions.</p>
