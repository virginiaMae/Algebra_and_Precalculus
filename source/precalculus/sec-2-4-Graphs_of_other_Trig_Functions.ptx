    <title>Graphs of Other Trig Functions</title>
    <p><em>Graphs of Other Trig Functions</em> shows the graphs of 
        <m>y = \tan x</m>, <m>y = \cot x</m>, <m>y = \sec x</m> and <m>y = \csc x</m>. The lesson does 
        not cover transformations of these graphs as they have little application. The main use of the 
        graph of <m>y = \tan x</m> is to be able to talk about <m>y = \arctan x</m>, which is useful 
        in some contexts.</p>
