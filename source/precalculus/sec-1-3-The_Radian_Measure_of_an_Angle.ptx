    <title>The Radian Measure of an Angle</title>
    <p><em>The Radian Measure of an Angle</em> establishes the connection between angles measured on the 
      unit circle in degrees and the arc length around the circumference of the circle. Sine and 
      cosine values are referenced, though they are not taught in this lesson, nor are they important here. 
      Conversions from radians to degrees and from degrees to radians are performed.</p>
