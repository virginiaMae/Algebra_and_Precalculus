  <title>Sequences and Series</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>Chapter 8 gives a brief introduction to sequences and series. 
        <xref ref="sec-8-2-Sigma_Notation" text="title"/> is introduced, as well as 
        <xref ref="sec-8-3-Arithmetic_Sequences" text="title"/> and 
        <xref ref="sec-8-4-Geometric_Sequences_and_Series" text="title"/>. Connections are made between 
         sequences and equations of lines and the explicit formula for an arithmetic sequence is 
        given as  <m>a_n = d(n) + a_0</m>. This differs from others formulation of  <m>a_n = a_1 + d(n - 1)</m>
          as the former more closely matches the slope-intercept form of a line <m>y = mx + b</m>. Similarly, a 
        connection is built between geometric sequences and exponential functions. Standard 
        techniques to find the sum of arithmetic and geometric series are also discussed.</p>
