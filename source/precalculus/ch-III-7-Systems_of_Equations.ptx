  <title>Systems of Equations</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>Chapter 7 cover solving systems of equations. The first two topics cover solving systems of linear 
        equations, first, the <m>2\times2</m> case, and then the <m>3\times3</m> case. Solutions are 
        found purely by elementary algebraic operations. No attempt is made here to make deeper 
        connections to the study of liner algebra. The third topic 
        <xref ref="sec-7-3-Solving_Systems_of_Non-Linear_Equations" text="title"/> examines the intersection of 
        conic sections, and familiarity with the equations of the circle, ellipse, parabola and ellipse is assumed.</p>
